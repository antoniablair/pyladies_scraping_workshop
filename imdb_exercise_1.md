# IMDB Exercise 1

## Let's scrape some film information.

Go to the IMDB page for Wonder Woman: 
[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451279/]('https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451279/')

Using Requests and Beautiful Soup, can you pull out: 

- The film’s title
- The summary description text underneath the title
- The rating (number of stars) the film received

Be sure to check the [requests]('http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/') and 
[BeautifulSoup]('https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/') documentation to view the syntax if you need
it.
