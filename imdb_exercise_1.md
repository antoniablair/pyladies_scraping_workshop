# IMDB Exercise 1

## Let's scrape some film information.

Go to the IMDB page for Wonder Woman: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0451279/

Using Requests and Beautiful Soup, can you print out:

- The filmâ€™s title
- The summary description text underneath the title
- The rating (number of stars) the film received

Be sure to check the [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and
[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) documentation to view the syntax if you need
it!
